Why use Mad Mimi rather than action mailer?  Primarily since it allows you to separate the design of your emails from the code. Create nice designs on  mad mimi, add analytics tracking urls, and update the contents of promotions via the mad mimi interface rather than trying to do it all in your code.

== DESCRIPTION:

Using Mad Mimi on rails 3.  All of the elegant portions of the code are based on the original http://github.com/redsquirrel/mad_mimi_mailer by ethangunderson.

All of the terrible stuff is by me.  Apologies for taking an elegant solution and just crafting something that works.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* FIX (list of features or problems)
This has only been tested on Ruby 1.8.7.
Testing on Ruby 1.9 required.
Currently against rails 3 beta

If someone could suggest how to get rid of this I would be grateful:
./lib/mad_mimi_two/mad_mimi_mailer.rb:71: warning: default `to_a' will be obsolete

== SYNOPSIS:
== API CONFIG 
Setup your api key in application.rb  (at the end of the file, after the end for the config)
 MadMimiTwo::MadMimiMessage.api_settings = {
    :username => 'your_username@xys.com',
    :api_key => 'your api key'
  }

== GEMFILE:
gem 'mad_mimi_two'

== MIMI MODEL
set up model  in your rails model directory (something like the following)
class MadMimi <  MadMimiTwo::MadMimiMessage
  def self.mimi_promotion(tpromotion,tuser,thashvalues,cclist, tsubj)
    msg=MadMimiTwo::MadMimiMessage.new do
      	  subject    tsubj
     to tuser
     cc          cclist
     promotion   tpromotion  #[MAD MIMI PROMOTION NAME]
     from       'support@estormtech.com'
     bcc        ["xyze@estormtech.com", "abc@estormtech.com"]
     email_placeholders        thashvalues  # [VALUES THAT NEED TO BE INSERTED AT MAD MIMI EMAIL  these are the values in {} in the mad mimi email that you want replaced  eg {:url='www.estormtech.com'}]
     content_type "text/html" 
   end
   msg.deliver_mimi_message  # will return the mimi id -like 1151306886 if all ok.
  end
end

to use it:
MadMimi.mimi_promotion('promoname','test@email.com',{:url=>'www.estormtech.com'},'cc@email.com','demo subject')
this will return a ID from mad mimi like 1151260526

== Mail::Message
As this is subclassed from Mail::Message I believe that other ways to create the message will also work (such as passing in hash, etc (see the documentation))

== REQUIREMENTS:

gem activesupport
gem mail
(but both of these needed for rails)

== INSTALL:

gem install mad_mimi_two   (it is now up on rubygems.org)

== RAILS TESTING:

Apologies but this needs work.  I have simple tests in my application but nothing spectaculre.
